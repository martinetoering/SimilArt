## Meeting notes

### Meeting 1, 13 February 2020
- design is very important
- 3 questions that user can answer with visualisation (motivation to open tool)
    - find new pictures that I like (similar to what I already know I like), with specific criteria
    - exploring new pictures
    - compare similar pictures
- modalities: what happens when you change timeline, explain what each component does, what does it mean (center image is query image, others are answer) and how does it use the design primivites: scale, design, color, location
- make model to compare images (Machine Leaning, similarities, features) (pretrained)
- Focus is on the center part of the design sketch and not on other windows and features
- Meeting next week: choose a subset (portraits or other genre), discuss model
